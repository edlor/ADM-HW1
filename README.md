# ADM2021-HW1
First homework for the Algorithmic Methods of Data Mining course of the Master's Degree in Data Science at Sapienza.

In the `scripts` folder you'll find the solutions to all the exercises organised in Jupyter Notebooks: one for each of the categories of Problem 1, and one for all the challenges of Problem 2.

In the `stamps` folder you'll find a PDF printout of my *journey* through the Homework, with a list of every successful and failed submission for each of the challenges.

I haven't looked at any of the solutions, but after the more challenging exercises I did occasionally take a look at other people's answers on the *Discussions* page **after** my final submission.

Every submission passes all test cases except for **Recursive Digit Sum** in `problem2.ipynb`; I explain the reasons why there.
